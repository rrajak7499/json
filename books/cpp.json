Since the course is intended for graduates from disciplines other than Computer Science, very little previous programming experience is assumed. This note covers the following topics: introducing C++,  ANSI/ISO C, the C++ programming environment in unix, an example C++ program, very simple input output and assignment, simple flow of control, preliminary remarks about program style, variables types and expressions, identifiers, data types, integers, real numbers, type casting, characters, strings, user defined data types,etc..",
